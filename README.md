# PrecompileSignatures.jl

This is an experimental package which reads all method signatures in a package and generates precompile directives for any concrete signature that it can find.

## Usage

Add this package to your package `Foo`:

```julia
pkg> activate Foo

(Foo) pkg> add PrecompileSignatures
```

Next, add `@precompile_module(Foo)` somewhere after your module's logic.
For example:

```julia
module Foo

using PrecompileSignatures: @precompile_module

[...]

# Include generated `precompile` directives for this module.
@precompile_module(Foo)

end # module
```

This will generate extra `precompile` directives during the precompilation phase and `include` the generated file.

## How does this package work?

This package finds precompile directives by searching for concrete types in method signatures.
For example, for the function
```julia
function f(x::Int, y::Float64)
    return x
end
```

this package will generate

```julia
precompile(Tuple{typeof(f), Int, Float64})
```

Also, this package will create `precompile` directives for `(Int, Float64)` and `(Float32, Float64)` from the following method definitions:

```julia
function f(x, y)
    return x
end
f(x::Union{Int,Float32}, y::Float64}) = f(x)
```

This splitting of union types can be disabled by setting `split_union=false`.

**Note**

Unfortunately, writing

```julia
function f(x::Union{Float64,Float32,Any}, y::Float64})
    return x
end
```

doesn't generate `precompile` directives for `Float64` and `Float32` on `x` because the signature is simplified to `Any` by Julia's internals:

```julia
julia> z(x::Union{Int,Any}) = x;

julia> only(methods(z)).sig
Tuple{typeof(z), Any}
```

In other words, this package cannot easily extract all types mentioned in the union in this case.

## By how much does this package reduce the time to first X?

Depends on the package.
The more signatures a package has with concretely typed arguments, the more `precompile` directives can be added.
Next, the better the types inside the methods can be infered, the more performance can be gained from adding the directives.
As an indication, in this package the time for the first `@time @eval precompilables(PrecompileSignatures)` is reduced by 0.3 seconds (-15%) and 134 MiB allocations (-19%).
In [`Pluto.jl`](https://github.com/fonsp/Pluto.jl), the compile time benchmark is 3 seconds faster (-3%) and 1.6 GiB allocations less (-47%), see https://github.com/fonsp/Pluto.jl/pull/2054 for details.
Both these numbers are obtained with Julia 1.8-beta3.

## How does this package compare to running code during the precompilation phase?

Some packages nowadays run code during the precompilation phase.
For example, at the time of writing, [`Makie.jl`](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/Makie.jl) runs

```julia
## src/precompiles.jl
function _precompile_()
    ccall(:jl_generating_output, Cint, ()) == 1 || return nothing
    f, ax1, pl = scatter(1:4)
    f, ax2, pl = lines(1:4)
    f = Figure()
    Axis(f[1,1])
    return
end

## src/Makie.jl
if Base.VERSION >= v"1.4.2"
    include("precompiles.jl")
    _precompile_()
end
```

What happens here is that the code such as `lines(1:4)` is executed during the precompilation phase.
While running the code, Julia will compile all methods that it needs to run the code.

In contrast, `PrecompileSignatures.jl` would call precompile directives such as `precompile(lines, (UnitRange{Int},))`.
The benefit is that this will not actually run the code.
However because of that, it will also not be able to precompile everything since some types cannot be infered when going through methods recursively.
That's why the TTFX performance of this package lies somewhere in between actually calling the code and not calling the code nor calling `precompile`.

So firstly, the strength of this package is mostly to automatically decide what to precompile.
You don't need to manually figure out what code to run.
Secondly, the strength of this package lies in codebases where the code cannot easily be called during the precompilation phase.
For example, for code with side-effects such as disk or network operations.

## How does this package compare to SnoopCompile?

Like this package, [SnoopCompile.jl](https://github.com/timholy/SnoopCompile.jl) can also generate precompile directives.
Where this package does it by reading code and signatures, SnoopCompile runs code to find directives.
Because SnoopCompile runs the code, it can find much more directives.
However, the problem with running code is that it takes long.
For example, to generate a lot of precompile directives in [Pluto.jl](https://github.com/fonsp/Pluto.jl), we could run all tests.
This takes about 20 minutes.
Conversely, this package takes about 6 seconds to generate directives for all modules in Pluto.
In practise, this means that this package can re-generate the directives with each start of the package whereas SnoopCompile's directives have to be cached, that is, stored in the repository.

## Further notes

Unfortunately, in many cases, inference will run all over again even after some method has been "precompiled".
For more information about this, see https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/issues/38951#issuecomment-749153888 and the related discussions.
This aspect is a work-in-progress.
For example, a recent PR that got merged related to this is "Cache external CodeInstances" (https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/pull/43990).
With the great work that is done at the Julia-side, this package is expected to make a bigger difference over time.
